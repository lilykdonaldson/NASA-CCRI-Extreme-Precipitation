        <h1>Deciphering Changing Probabilities of Extreme Climate Events in Climate Models and Measurements</h1>
        <p>This project was developed during the 2023-2024 session of <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/edu/ccri/">NASA GISS' Climate Change Research Initiative.</a></p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Mean changes in temperature and precipitation under a changing climate are well-understood, but future changes to extreme weather, particularly precipitation, are less known. <strong>In this project, we explored the implications of warmer and wetter weather conditions induced by climate change on extratropical cyclones (ETCs) in the Northern Hemisphere.</strong> ETCs, including Bomb Cyclones (a particularly intense form of ETC), are responsible for 80% of winter precipitation in mid-latitudes (Naud et al. 2022). However, the future frequency and intensity of ETCs under a changing climate are unknown. Additionally, atmospheric rivers will become more frequent and intense under a warming climate (Zhang et al. 2024), and ETCs that are concurrent with these ARs tend to be more intense (Zhang et al. 2019). We aimed to investigate <strong>how the frequency and intensity of bombing extratropical cyclones, including those that are concurrent with an atmospheric river, are changing under a warming climate,</strong> and if these changes are accurately reflected in climate models. We developed a method for identifying extratropical cyclones in gridded datasets which we applied to MERRA-2 and ERA-5 reanalysis data. We found that within the reanalysis data, extratropical cyclone frequency is higher during PNA+ and NAO- events, and bomb cyclone frequency is higher during PNA+ events. In future research, trend analysis and application of the described method on CMIP6 simulations should be done to further understand how ETCs and Bomb Cyclones are changing. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Due to anthropogenic activities since the Industrial Revolution, the earth’s climate has been experiencing substantial changes. From 2011 to 2020, global surface temperature has reached 1.1 °C above pre-industrial levels (IPCC AR6) and is projected to rise. The increase in global temperature will throw off the equilibrium of the earth's systems, creating environmental, societal, and economic impacts.</p>

            <p>Human-induced climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events in every region of the world, including those related to precipitation. Under a changing climate, weather will be warmer and thus wetter. This phenomenon is supported by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which describes how the saturation vapor pressure of water increases exponentially with temperature, leading to more moisture in the atmosphere and potentially heavier precipitation events (Martinkova et al. 2020). Future climate is likely to have an increase in both frequency and intensity of precipitation events (Myhre et al. 2019).</p>

            <p>Since the 1950s, most regions of the world have experienced increases in hot extremes, 21 out of 46 global regions experienced an increase in heavy precipitation, and West and Central Africa as well as parts of Europe and Asia experienced more occurrences of drought (IPCC AR6).</p>

            <p>Understanding the shifting probabilities of extreme climate events is incredibly important to prepare the world for the escalating occurrences of severe weather phenomena. As precipitation patterns shift, it is paramount for us to be ready for both extreme precipitation events (which can have consequences such as severe flooding, landslides, infrastructure damage, and proliferation of waterborne diseases) and droughts (which can have consequences such as water supply shortages, agricultural impacts, and increased risk of wildfires).</p>
