        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Mean changes in temperature and precipitation under a changing climate are well-understood, but future changes to extreme weather, particularly precipitation, are less known. <strong>In this project, we explored the implications of warmer and wetter weather conditions induced by climate change on extratropical cyclones (ETCs) in the Northern Hemisphere.</strong> ETCs, including Bomb Cyclones (a particularly intense form of ETC), are responsible for 80% of winter precipitation in mid-latitudes (Naud et al. 2022). However, the future frequency and intensity of ETCs under a changing climate are unknown. Additionally, atmospheric rivers will become more frequent and intense under a warming climate (Zhang et al. 2024), and ETCs that are concurrent with these ARs tend to be more intense (Zhang et al. 2019). We aimed to investigate <strong>how the frequency and intensity of bombing extratropical cyclones, including those that are concurrent with an atmospheric river, are changing under a warming climate,</strong> and if these changes are accurately reflected in climate models. We developed a method for identifying extratropical cyclones in gridded datasets which we applied to MERRA-2 and ERA-5 reanalysis data. We found that within the reanalysis data, extratropical cyclone frequency is higher during PNA+ and NAO- events, and bomb cyclone frequency is higher during PNA+ events. In future research, trend analysis and application of the described method on CMIP6 simulations should be done to further understand how ETCs and Bomb Cyclones are changing. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Due to anthropogenic activities since the Industrial Revolution, the earth’s climate has been experiencing substantial changes. From 2011 to 2020, global surface temperature has reached 1.1 °C above pre-industrial levels (IPCC AR6) and is projected to rise. The increase in global temperature will throw off the equilibrium of the earth's systems, creating environmental, societal, and economic impacts.</p>

            <p>Human-induced climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events in every region of the world, including those related to precipitation. Under a changing climate, weather will be warmer and thus wetter. This phenomenon is supported by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which describes how the saturation vapor pressure of water increases exponentially with temperature, leading to more moisture in the atmosphere and potentially heavier precipitation events (Martinkova et al. 2020). Future climate is likely to have an increase in both frequency and intensity of precipitation events (Myhre et al. 2019).</p>

            <p>Since the 1950s, most regions of the world have experienced increases in hot extremes, 21 out of 46 global regions experienced an increase in heavy precipitation, and West and Central Africa as well as parts of Europe and Asia experienced more occurrences of drought (IPCC AR6).</p>

            <p>Understanding the shifting probabilities of extreme climate events is incredibly important to prepare the world for the escalating occurrences of severe weather phenomena. As precipitation patterns shift, it is paramount for us to be ready for both extreme precipitation events (which can have consequences such as severe flooding, landslides, infrastructure damage, and proliferation of waterborne diseases) and droughts (which can have consequences such as water supply shortages, agricultural impacts, and increased risk of wildfires).</p>

            <h3>A High Level View of Precipitation Patterns</h3>
            <h4>How Precipitation Patterns are Changing in the United States</h4>
            <p>
                As global temperature increases, there will be an increase in annual hottest-days and wettest-days (<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf">IPCC AR6</a>). The frequency of extreme precipitation events is projected to increase significantly with global warming, with total precipitation from these events nearly doubling per degree of warming, primarily due to increased frequency rather than intensity. This trend, observed in both climate models and actual observations, suggests that the most intense precipitation events will become almost twice as common with each additional degree of global warming (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-52277-4">Myhre et al. 2019</a>).

            </p>
            <p>
                A precipitation return value is a statistical estimate representing the magnitude of a precipitation event that is expected to occur once in a given period. For example, a 100-year return value (sometimes called the '100 year storm' or 'once in a 100 year storm') refers to an extreme rainfall event that has a 1% chance of happening in any given year. Since the 1950s, precipitation return values have generally increased in the Eastern United States and decreased in the Western United States (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1453-8">Wu 2015</a>).
            </p>

            <img src="images/Risser_return_values.GIF" alt="An animation showing precipitation 10, 20, 50, and 100 year return values plotted in the contiguous USA from 1955-2015." class="center-image">
            <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 2: Precipitation Return Values across the contiguous United States based on Weather Station Data over Several Decades (1955-2015)</strong> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04636-0">Risser et al. 2019</a>)<br></p>

                <strong>Findings from the 2023 National Climate Assessment (<a href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/chapter/4/">NCA-5</a>):</strong><br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extreme precipitation patterns in the United States are undergoing significant changes due to climate change. The intensity and frequency of the heaviest precipitation events are increasing, posing heightened risks to both people and nature. </li>
                <li>Regions like Alaska and the northern and eastern parts of the U.S. are experiencing, and are expected to continue experiencing, more average precipitation, whereas areas such as Hawai'i and the southwestern U.S. are seeing declines. These shifts contribute to an increase in heavier rainfall events nationwide, with very high confidence that these trends will continue.</li>
                <li>Increased temperatures are expected to enhance evaporation and plant water use, especially where moisture is plentiful, further stressing groundwater supplies.</li>
                <li>As snow cover diminishes and melts earlier, these changes threaten freshwater availability, exacerbate flood damage, and increase drought impacts.</li>
                <li>These changes in precipitation patterns particularly affect socioeconomically disadvantaged communities and those on the frontlines of climate change.</li>
                <li>The combined effect of more frequent and intense precipitation events necessitates rapid adaptation to mitigate the associated flood and drought-related challenges.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Climate Models and Precipitation</h4>
            <p>
                Climate models are essential for assessing climate variability and designing infrastructure, but they may not accurately predict precipitation extremes, which are expected to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021EF002196">Abdelmoaty et al. 2021</a>). Climate models often struggle to accurately predict precipitation extremes due to several inherent biases and limitations. One key issue is the "drizzling bias," where models tend to simulate precipitation events that are too frequent and prolonged but with lower intensity compared to observations. This results in an overestimation of light rain events and an underestimation of heavy precipitation events. Coarser models exacerbate this problem as they rely heavily on parameterized convective precipitation, which is more drizzle-like (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JD034198">Chen et al. 2021</a>).
            </p>
            <p>Working with NASA's GISS ModelE2.1, a coarser resolution general circulation model (GCM) amongst the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/cmip6-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-explained/">CMIP6</a> group (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS002034">Miller et al. 2020</a>), we found differences between the model's representation of precipitation distribution and observational data. We used IMERG v.7, a remote sensing product distributed by the NASA Global Precipitation Measurement Mission, as our observational comparison (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5067/GPM/IMERG/3B-HH-E/07">GPM_3IMERGHHE</a>).

            <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 3: Comparative Analysis of Precipitation Distribution: The NASA GISS Climate Model vs. IMERG v.7 Remote Sensing Data</strong><br>Compared to sattelite retrievals from IMERG v.7, the GISS climate model (ModelE2.1) does not capture the most extreme of precipitation in New York City 2011-2020. While the GISS model's precipitation values had a slightly higher average and 95th percentile than IMERG for this region, the observed IMERG precipation values had a 25% higher 99th percentile value than GISS.</p>
            </figure>

            <h3>Extratropical Cyclones (ETCs)</h3>
            <p>An <strong>extratropical cyclone</strong> is a large-scale weather system that forms outside the tropics, typically featuring a low-pressure center, cold and warm fronts, and associated weather patterns such as strong winds, rain, and sometimes snow. Extratropical cyclones are a major component of mid-latitude precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere, accounting for approximately 80% of winter precipitation in this region (Naud et al. 2022). ETCs which undergo bombogenesis, or <strong>‘bomb cyclones’</strong>, account for particularly heavy precipitation (Seiler et al. 2016). There is a lack of consensus on how extratropical cyclones (ETCs) will change under a warming climate (Naud et al. 2022), and the majority of CMIP5 climate models struggle to accurately predict the frequency of bomb cyclone occurrence (Seiler et al. 2016). Additionally, ETCs have stronger effects when they are concurrent with <strong>Atmospheric Rivers,</strong> or ARs, (Zhang et al. 2019) and the frequency and intensity of ARs is predicted to increase under the changing climate (Zhang et al. 2024).</p>

        </figure>
            <h3>Bomb Cyclones</h3>
            <p>Bomb Cyclones are extratropical cyclones which undergo rapid intensification due to a rapid drop in pressure at their storm center. Bomb Cyclones are generally characterized by a pressure drop of at least 24 millibars within 24 hours, but this pressure drop threshold is latitude dependent and may be less than 24 millibars in some cases (Sanders and Gyakum 1980). Bomb Cyclones can produce severe weather conditions, including heavy snowfall, strong winds, and coastal flooding, making them particularly dangerous and impactful. They often originate from the western North Atlantic in the winter months.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Bomb Cyclone example.gif" alt="This plot is an animation of a bomb cyclone showing air temperature and pressure." class="center-image">
            <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 3: An Example of a Bomb Cyclone</strong> (<a href="https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/2022-12-21-what-is-a-bomb-cyclone-bombogenesis">source: weather.com</a>).<br>This animation shows a cold air mass (high pressure system) moving southeast while a warmer air mass (low pressure system) moves northward. The steep gradient in temperature and air pressure created a dangerous bomb cyclone on this date.</p>
        </figure>
            <h3>Atmospheric Rivers</h3>
            <p>An <strong>atmospheric river</strong> is a narrow corridor of concentrated moisture in the atmosphere that can transport vast amounts of water vapor from tropical regions to mid-latitudes, and they are <strong>often associated with extratropical cyclones</strong> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL105828">LeGrande et al. 2024</a>). ARs can stretch for thousands of kilometers and are often responsible for significant rainfall when they make landfall, potentially leading to flooding. Atmospheric rivers play a crucial role in the global water cycle but can also cause severe weather impacts, such as heavy precipitation and strong winds (<a href="https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/home/micro-articles/atmospheric-rivers">NASA GHRC</a>). Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are most often associated with western coastal regions, but they also have impacts beyond those regions, including across the U.S. East Coast (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL107236">O'Brien et al. 2024</a>). <strong>Both extratropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers tend to be stronger when they are combined </strong>(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL079071">Zhang et al. 2019</a>). Approximately 80% of cyclones in North Atlantic and North Pacific basins that undergo bombogenesis (i.e. bomb cyclones) are linked to the presence of an AR; in contrast, less than half of cyclones that do not undergo bombogenesis (i.e. non-bombing cyclones) are associated with an atmospheric river (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-91-2018">Eiras-Barca et al. 2018</a>). There is projected to be a 50% increase in AR occurrence globally by the late 21st century (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-020-0030-5">Payne et al. 2020</a>). 
            </p>

        </figure>
        <h3>Research Question</h3>
        <p>
            With a focus on the <strong>U.S. East Coast</strong>, we aimed to investigate <strong>how the frequency and intensity of extratropical cyclones, and specifically bomb cyclones, are represented in various datasets</strong> (including reanalysis and climate models) and how their characteristics are changing under climate change. Additionally, because ETCs have stronger effects when they are concurrent with atmospheric rivers, (Zhang et al. 2019) and the frequency and intensity of ARs is predicted to increase under the changing climate (Zhang et al. 2024), we also aimed to investigate <strong>atmospheric concurrent</strong> ETCs and BCs.
