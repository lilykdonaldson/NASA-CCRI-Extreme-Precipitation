        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Mean changes in temperature and precipitation under a changing climate are well-understood, but future changes to extreme weather, particularly precipitation, are less known. <strong>In this project, we explored the implications of warmer and wetter weather conditions induced by climate change on extratropical cyclones (ETCs) in the Northern Hemisphere.</strong> ETCs, including Bomb Cyclones (a particularly intense form of ETC), are responsible for 80% of winter precipitation in mid-latitudes (Naud et al. 2022). However, the future frequency and intensity of ETCs under a changing climate are unknown. Additionally, atmospheric rivers will become more frequent and intense under a warming climate (Zhang et al. 2024), and ETCs that are concurrent with these ARs tend to be more intense (Zhang et al. 2019). We aimed to investigate <strong>how the frequency and intensity of bombing extratropical cyclones, including those that are concurrent with an atmospheric river, are changing under a warming climate,</strong> and if these changes are accurately reflected in climate models. We developed a method for identifying extratropical cyclones in gridded datasets which we applied to MERRA-2 and ERA-5 reanalysis data. We found that within the reanalysis data, extratropical cyclone frequency is higher during PNA+ and NAO- events, and bomb cyclone frequency is higher during PNA+ events. In future research, trend analysis and application of the described method on CMIP6 simulations should be done to further understand how ETCs and Bomb Cyclones are changing. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Due to anthropogenic activities since the Industrial Revolution, the earth’s climate has been experiencing substantial changes. From 2011 to 2020, global surface temperature has reached 1.1 °C above pre-industrial levels (IPCC AR6) and is projected to rise. The increase in global temperature will throw off the equilibrium of the earth's systems, creating environmental, societal, and economic impacts.</p>

            <p>Human-induced climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events in every region of the world, including those related to precipitation. Under a changing climate, weather will be warmer and thus wetter. This phenomenon is supported by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which describes how the saturation vapor pressure of water increases exponentially with temperature, leading to more moisture in the atmosphere and potentially heavier precipitation events (Martinkova et al. 2020). Future climate is likely to have an increase in both frequency and intensity of precipitation events (Myhre et al. 2019).</p>

            <p>Since the 1950s, most regions of the world have experienced increases in hot extremes, 21 out of 46 global regions experienced an increase in heavy precipitation, and West and Central Africa as well as parts of Europe and Asia experienced more occurrences of drought (IPCC AR6).</p>

            <p>Understanding the shifting probabilities of extreme climate events is incredibly important to prepare the world for the escalating occurrences of severe weather phenomena. As precipitation patterns shift, it is paramount for us to be ready for both extreme precipitation events (which can have consequences such as severe flooding, landslides, infrastructure damage, and proliferation of waterborne diseases) and droughts (which can have consequences such as water supply shortages, agricultural impacts, and increased risk of wildfires).</p>
            <h3>Extratropical Cyclones (ETCs)</h3>
            <p>An <strong>extratropical cyclone</strong> is a large-scale weather system that forms outside the tropics, typically featuring a low-pressure center, cold and warm fronts, and associated weather patterns such as strong winds, rain, and sometimes snow. Extratropical cyclones are a major component of mid-latitude precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere, accounting for approximately 80% of winter precipitation in this region (Naud et al. 2022). ETCs which undergo bombogenesis, or <strong>‘bomb cyclones’</strong>, account for particularly heavy precipitation (Seiler et al. 2016). There is a lack of consensus on how extratropical cyclones (ETCs) will change under a warming climate (Naud et al. 2022), and the majority of CMIP5 climate models struggle to accurately predict the frequency of bomb cyclone occurrence (Seiler et al. 2016). Additionally, ETCs have stronger effects when they are concurrent with <strong>Atmospheric Rivers,</strong> or ARs, (Zhang et al. 2019) and the frequency and intensity of ARs is predicted to increase under the changing climate (Zhang et al. 2024).</p>

            <h3>Bomb Cyclones</h3>
            <p>Bomb Cyclones are extratropical cyclones which undergo rapid intensification due to a rapid drop in pressure at their storm center. Bomb Cyclones are generally characterized by a pressure drop of at least 24 millibars within 24 hours, but this pressure drop threshold is latitude dependent and may be less than 24 millibars in some cases (Sanders and Gyakum 1980). Bomb Cyclones can produce severe weather conditions, including heavy snowfall, strong winds, and coastal flooding, making them particularly dangerous and impactful. They often originate from the western North Atlantic in the winter months.

The steep gradient in temperature and air pressure created a dangerous bomb cyclone on this date.</p>
        </figure>
            <h3>Atmospheric Rivers</h3>
            <p>An <strong>atmospheric river</strong> is a narrow corridor of concentrated moisture in the atmosphere that can transport vast amounts of water vapor from tropical regions to mid-latitudes, and they are <strong>often associated with extratropical cyclones</strong> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL105828">LeGrande et al. 2024</a>). ARs can stretch for thousands of kilometers and are often responsible for significant rainfall when they make landfall, potentially leading to flooding. Atmospheric rivers play a crucial role in the global water cycle but can also cause severe weather impacts, such as heavy precipitation and strong winds (<a href="https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/home/micro-articles/atmospheric-rivers">NASA GHRC</a>). Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are most often associated with western coastal regions, but they also have impacts beyond those regions, including across the U.S. East Coast (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL107236">O'Brien et al. 2024</a>). <strong>Both extratropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers tend to be stronger when they are combined </strong>(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL079071">Zhang et al. 2019</a>). Approximately 80% of cyclones in North Atlantic and North Pacific basins that undergo bombogenesis (i.e. bomb cyclones) are linked to the presence of an AR; in contrast, less than half of cyclones that do not undergo bombogenesis (i.e. non-bombing cyclones) are associated with an atmospheric river (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-91-2018">Eiras-Barca et al. 2018</a>). There is projected to be a 50% increase in AR occurrence globally by the late 21st century (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-020-0030-5">Payne et al. 2020</a>).

        <h3>Research Question</h3>
        <p>
            With a focus on the <strong>U.S. East Coast</strong>, we aimed to investigate <strong>how the frequency and intensity of extratropical cyclones, and specifically bomb cyclones, are represented in various datasets</strong> (including reanalysis and climate models) and how their characteristics are changing under climate change. Additionally, because ETCs have stronger effects when they are concurrent with atmospheric rivers, (Zhang 2019) and the frequency and intensity of ARs is predicted to increase under the changing climate (Zhang 2024), we also aimed to investigate <strong>atmospheric concurrent</strong> ETCs and BCs.
