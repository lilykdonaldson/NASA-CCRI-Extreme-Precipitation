        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Mean changes in temperature and precipitation under a changing climate are well-understood, but future changes to extreme weather, particularly precipitation, are less known. <strong>In this project, we explored the implications of warmer and wetter weather conditions induced by climate change on extratropical cyclones (ETCs) in the Northern Hemisphere.</strong> ETCs, including Bomb Cyclones (a particularly intense form of ETC), are responsible for 80% of winter precipitation in mid-latitudes (Naud et al. 2022). However, the future frequency and intensity of ETCs under a changing climate are unknown. Additionally, atmospheric rivers will become more frequent and intense under a warming climate (Zhang et al. 2024), and ETCs that are concurrent with these ARs tend to be more intense (Zhang et al. 2019). We aimed to investigate <strong>how the frequency and intensity of bombing extratropical cyclones, including those that are concurrent with an atmospheric river, are changing under a warming climate,</strong> and if these changes are accurately reflected in climate models. We developed a method for identifying extratropical cyclones in gridded datasets which we applied to MERRA-2 and ERA-5 reanalysis data. We found that within the reanalysis data, extratropical cyclone frequency is higher during PNA+ and NAO- events, and bomb cyclone frequency is higher during PNA+ events. In future research, trend analysis and application of the described method on CMIP6 simulations should be done to further understand how ETCs and Bomb Cyclones are changing. </p>
        <h2>Plain Language Summary</h2>
        <p>Climate change is causing general changes in temperature and precipitation that scientists understand well, but how extreme weather events, especially heavy rainfall, will change is less clear. This project studied how warmer and wetter conditions from climate change affect extratropical cyclones (ETCs) in the Northern Hemisphere. ETCs, including a severe type called Bomb Cyclones, produce 80% of winter rainfall in mid-latitude regions. However, it’s uncertain how their frequency and intensity will change in the future. Additionally, atmospheric rivers (ARs), which will become more frequent and stronger with climate change, often make ETCs more intense. Our research aimed to find out how often and how intensely Bomb Cyclones occur, especially when combined with atmospheric rivers, under a warming climate. We used a method to identify these cyclones in specific datasets (MERRA-2 and ERA-5 reanalysis data). We discovered that extratropical cyclones are more common during certain weather patterns (PNA+ and NAO- events), and Bomb Cyclones happen more often during PNA+ events. Future research should use this method on climate model simulations (CMIP6) to better understand how ETCs and Bomb Cyclones are changing.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Due to anthropogenic activities since the Industrial Revolution, the earth’s climate has been experiencing substantial changes. From 2011 to 2020, global surface temperature has reached 1.1 °C above pre-industrial levels (IPCC AR6) and is projected to rise. The increase in global temperature will throw off the equilibrium of the earth's systems, creating environmental, societal, and economic impacts.</p>

            <p>Human-induced climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events in every region of the world, including those related to precipitation. Under a changing climate, weather will be warmer and thus wetter. This phenomenon is supported by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which describes how the saturation vapor pressure of water increases exponentially with temperature, leading to more moisture in the atmosphere and potentially heavier precipitation events (Martinkova et al. 2020). Future climate is likely to have an increase in both frequency and intensity of precipitation events (Myhre et al. 2019).</p>

            <p>Since the 1950s, most regions of the world have experienced increases in hot extremes, 21 out of 46 global regions experienced an increase in heavy precipitation, and West and Central Africa as well as parts of Europe and Asia experienced more occurrences of drought (IPCC AR6).</p>

            <p>Understanding the shifting probabilities of extreme climate events is incredibly important to prepare the world for the escalating occurrences of severe weather phenomena. As precipitation patterns shift, it is paramount for us to be ready for both extreme precipitation events (which can have consequences such as severe flooding, landslides, infrastructure damage, and proliferation of waterborne diseases) and droughts (which can have consequences such as water supply shortages, agricultural impacts, and increased risk of wildfires).</p>

            <h3>A High Level View of Precipitation Patterns</h3>
            <h4>How Precipitation Patterns are Changing in the United States</h4>
            <p>
                As global temperature increases, there will be an increase in annual hottest-days and wettest-days (<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf">IPCC AR6</a>). The frequency of extreme precipitation events is projected to increase significantly with global warming, with total precipitation from these events nearly doubling per degree of warming, primarily due to increased frequency rather than intensity. This trend, observed in both climate models and actual observations, suggests that the most intense precipitation events will become almost twice as common with each additional degree of global warming (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-52277-4">Myhre et al. 2019</a>).

            </p>
            <p>
                A precipitation return value is a statistical estimate representing the magnitude of a precipitation event that is expected to occur once in a given period. For example, a 100-year return value (sometimes called the '100 year storm' or 'once in a 100 year storm') refers to an extreme rainfall event that has a 1% chance of happening in any given year. Since the 1950s, precipitation return values have generally increased in the Eastern United States and decreased in the Western United States (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1453-8">Wu 2015</a>).
            </p>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extreme precipitation patterns in the United States are undergoing significant changes due to climate change. The intensity and frequency of the heaviest precipitation events are increasing, posing heightened risks to both people and nature. </li>
                <li>Regions like Alaska and the northern and eastern parts of the U.S. are experiencing, and are expected to continue experiencing, more average precipitation, whereas areas such as Hawai'i and the southwestern U.S. are seeing declines. These shifts contribute to an increase in heavier rainfall events nationwide, with very high confidence that these trends will continue.</li>
                <li>Increased temperatures are expected to enhance evaporation and plant water use, especially where moisture is plentiful, further stressing groundwater supplies.</li>
                <li>As snow cover diminishes and melts earlier, these changes threaten freshwater availability, exacerbate flood damage, and increase drought impacts.</li>
                <li>These changes in precipitation patterns particularly affect socioeconomically disadvantaged communities and those on the frontlines of climate change.</li>
                <li>The combined effect of more frequent and intense precipitation events necessitates rapid adaptation to mitigate the associated flood and drought-related challenges.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Climate Models and Precipitation</h4>
            <p>
                Climate models are essential for assessing climate variability and designing infrastructure, but they may not accurately predict precipitation extremes, which are expected to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021EF002196">Abdelmoaty et al. 2021</a>). Climate models often struggle to accurately predict precipitation extremes due to several inherent biases and limitations. One key issue is the "drizzling bias," where models tend to simulate precipitation events that are too frequent and prolonged but with lower intensity compared to observations. This results in an overestimation of light rain events and an underestimation of heavy precipitation events. Coarser models exacerbate this problem as they rely heavily on parameterized convective precipitation, which is more drizzle-like (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JD034198">Chen et al. 2021</a>).
            </p>
            <p>Working with NASA's GISS ModelE2.1, a coarser resolution general circulation model (GCM) amongst the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/cmip6-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-explained/">CMIP6</a> group (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS002034">Miller et al. 2020</a>), we found differences between the model's representation of precipitation distribution and observational data. We used IMERG v.7, a remote sensing product distributed by the NASA Global Precipitation Measurement Mission, as our observational comparison (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5067/GPM/IMERG/3B-HH-E/07">GPM_3IMERGHHE</a>).
            <figure>
            <img src="images/NYC PDF.png" alt="probability density functions for precipitation in GISS vs IMERG in NYC 2011-2020, GISS' average and 95th percentiles are slightly higher than IMERG but IMERG's 99th percentile is much higher than GISS" class="center-image">
            <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 3: Comparative Analysis of Precipitation Distribution: The NASA GISS Climate Model vs. IMERG v.7 Remote Sensing Data</strong><br>Compared to sattelite retrievals from IMERG v.7, the GISS climate model (ModelE2.1) does not capture the most extreme of precipitation in New York City 2011-2020. While the GISS model's precipitation values had a slightly higher average and 95th percentile than IMERG for this region, the observed IMERG precipitation values had a 25% higher 99th percentile value than GISS. The IMERG data used in this plot was regridded to the coarser GISS grid for comparison at the same resolution. <br><em>The source code for the regridding, preprocessing, and plotting used in this figure is available in this project's Github repository in the <a href="https://github.com/lilykdonaldson/NASA-CCRI-Extreme-Precipitation/tree/main/probability-density-functions">'Probability Density Functions' folder.</a></em></p>
            </figure>
            <h4>Extreme Precipitation Events</h4>
            <p>Having looked at extreme precipitation from a total distribution standpoint, we moved forward in the project examining individual precipition <em>events</em>. To start, we examined IMERG v.7 precipitation data for the New York City area from 2001 to 2022 to find precipitation events and rank them by total precipitation, precipitation rate, and precipitation events with the highest individual measurements. The source code used for this analysis is available in this project's Github repository in the <a href="https://github.com/lilykdonaldson/NASA-CCRI-Extreme-Precipitation/tree/main/top-precipitation-events">'Top Precipitation Events' folder.</a></p>
            <p>
            After we identified 100+ top precipitation events in New York City within IMERG v.7, we looked at the events individually by identifying if the event was in a <a href="https://www.weather.gov/okx/stormevents">National Weather Service (NWS)</a> or <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/">NOAA</a> database, if the event was declared a disaster by <a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations">FEMA</a>, and if the event had substantial news coverage. During this process, we discovered that many of the events we identified were Nor'easters (<a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/weather/2020/12/03/nor-easter-to-impact-region-this-weekend">including this one on December 5, 2020</a>) and Bomb Cyclones (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/17/weather/bomb-cyclone-new-york-boston/index.html">including this one on October 17, 2019</a>). We then shifted our research goal to focus on Bomb Cyclones (described below) and winter precipitation.
            </p>
            <h3>Extratropical Cyclones (ETCs)</h3>
            <p>An <strong>extratropical cyclone</strong> is a large-scale weather system that forms outside the tropics, typically featuring a low-pressure center, cold and warm fronts, and associated weather patterns such as strong winds, rain, and sometimes snow. Extratropical cyclones are a major component of mid-latitude precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere, accounting for approximately 80% of winter precipitation in this region (Naud et al. 2022). ETCs which undergo bombogenesis, or <strong>‘bomb cyclones’</strong>, account for particularly heavy precipitation (Seiler et al. 2016). There is a lack of consensus on how extratropical cyclones (ETCs) will change under a warming climate (Naud et al. 2022), and the majority of CMIP5 climate models struggle to accurately predict the frequency of bomb cyclone occurrence (Seiler et al. 2016). Additionally, ETCs have stronger effects when they are concurrent with <strong>Atmospheric Rivers,</strong> or ARs, (Zhang et al. 2019) and the frequency and intensity of ARs is predicted to increase under the changing climate (Zhang et al. 2024).</p>

        </figure>
            <h3>Bomb Cyclones</h3>
            <p>Bomb Cyclones are extratropical cyclones which undergo rapid intensification due to a rapid drop in pressure at their storm center. Bomb Cyclones are generally characterized by a pressure drop of at least 24 millibars within 24 hours, but this pressure drop threshold is latitude dependent and may be less than 24 millibars in some cases (Sanders and Gyakum 1980). Bomb Cyclones can produce severe weather conditions, including heavy snowfall, strong winds, and coastal flooding, making them particularly dangerous and impactful. They often originate from the western North Atlantic in the winter months.
        </p>

The steep gradient in temperature and air pressure created a dangerous bomb cyclone on this date.</p>
        </figure>
            <h3>Atmospheric Rivers</h3>
            <p>An <strong>atmospheric river</strong> is a narrow corridor of concentrated moisture in the atmosphere that can transport vast amounts of water vapor from tropical regions to mid-latitudes, and they are <strong>often associated with extratropical cyclones</strong> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL105828">LeGrande et al. 2024</a>). ARs can stretch for thousands of kilometers and are often responsible for significant rainfall when they make landfall, potentially leading to flooding. Atmospheric rivers play a crucial role in the global water cycle but can also cause severe weather impacts, such as heavy precipitation and strong winds (<a href="https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/home/micro-articles/atmospheric-rivers">NASA GHRC</a>). Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are most often associated with western coastal regions, but they also have impacts beyond those regions, including across the U.S. East Coast (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL107236">O'Brien et al. 2024</a>). <strong>Both extratropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers tend to be stronger when they are combined </strong>(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL079071">Zhang et al. 2019</a>). Approximately 80% of cyclones in North Atlantic and North Pacific basins that undergo bombogenesis (i.e. bomb cyclones) are linked to the presence of an AR; in contrast, less than half of cyclones that do not undergo bombogenesis (i.e. non-bombing cyclones) are associated with an atmospheric river (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-91-2018">Eiras-Barca et al. 2018</a>). There is projected to be a 50% increase in AR occurrence globally by the late 21st century (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-020-0030-5">Payne et al. 2020</a>).

        <h3>Research Question</h3>
        <p>
            With a focus on the <strong>U.S. East Coast</strong>, we aimed to investigate <strong>how the frequency and intensity of extratropical cyclones, and specifically bomb cyclones, are represented in various datasets</strong> (including reanalysis and climate models) and how their characteristics are changing under climate change. Additionally, because ETCs have stronger effects when they are concurrent with atmospheric rivers, (Zhang et al. 2019) and the frequency and intensity of ARs is predicted to increase under the changing climate (Zhang et al. 2024), we also aimed to investigate <strong>atmospheric concurrent</strong> ETCs and BCs.

            <h3>Method for Identifying Extratropical Cyclones, including Bombogenesis and Atmospheric River Concurrency, in Gridded Datasets</h3>
            <h4>Identifying Extratropical Cyclones</h4>
            <p>Our first method involved capturing extratropical cyclones identified in MERRA-2 and ERA-5 reanalysis using the <a href="https://gcss-dime.giss.nasa.gov/mcms/">MAP Climatology of Mid-latitude Storminess (MCMS) method</a> (<a href="doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00637.1">Booth et al. 2013</a>) which passed through our U.S. East and West Coast region masks in order to organize ETCs by relevant region. The global datasets of ETCs identified with MCMS were provided to us by <a href="https://portal.nccs.nasa.gov/datashare/Obs-ETC/Fronts-ETC/">Catherine M. Naud</a> (MERRA-2) and James Booth (ERA-5) (<a href="doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00637.1">Booth et al. 2013</a>). U.S. East and West Coast ETCs were captured from 2007-2021 in MERRA-2 and 1950-2023 in ERA-5.</p>

            <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 7: U.S. East and West Coast Region Masks.</strong> Coastal boundaries are based on <a href="https://reccap2-ocean.github.io/regions/">RECCAP2</a> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4545-2017, 2017">Laruelle et al. 2017</a>) In this plot, the white grid boxes represent land, and the purple grid boxes represent coastal ocean. These <a href="https://github.com/lilykdonaldson/NASA-CCRI-Extreme-Precipitation/tree/main/ETC-search-and-identify/USA_coast_region_masks">mask files</a> are available in this project's Github repository.</p>
        </figure>
            <h4>Identifying Bombogenesis</h4>
            <p>After regionally relevant ETCs were identified, each of the ETCs’ storm paths were searched for pressure drops associated with bombogenesis as defined by the latitude dependent equations set forth by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1980)108<1589:SDCOT>2.0.CO;2">Sanders and Gyakum 1980</a>. Pressure drops were considered at the storm’s center and within 4 degrees orthogonal and diagonal to the storm’s center, all along the storm’s path. If the pressure drop threshold was met during a 24 hour time period at any center point along the storm's track, the ETC was marked as “bomb”; if no pressure drops that met the threshold were found, the storm was marked as “non-bomb”.</p>
            <h4>Identifying Atmospheric River Concurrency</h4>
            <p>The area around each ETC was checked for Atmospheric Rivers to determine AR-concurrency. Identified atmospheric rivers were sourced from GISS ModelE2.1 nudged to MERRA-2 horizontal winds (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL105828">LeGrande et al. 2024</a>), but in the future should be sourced from ERA5 or MERRA-2 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03258-4">Guan and Waliser 2024</a>, database of ARs available on <a href="https://dataverse.ucla.edu/dataverse/ar">UCLA Dataverse</a>). A composite of an AR-concurrent ETC from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL079071">Zhang et al. 2019</a> was used to determine a proximity box in which ARs were associated with the ETC in question. If an atmospheric river existed within the proximity box identified at any timestep of the storm, the storm was marked as 'AR-concurrent'.

The red square shows the proximity box used to identify Atmospheric River concurrency in our project.</p>
        </figure>
            <h4>Identifying Storm-Specific Precipitation</h4>
            <p>We developed a method to identify storm-specific precipitation by finding the Sea Level Pressure (SLP) closed loop farthest away from the storm center which contains the storm center. To achieve this, we first loaded the SLP data and used the Haversine formula to calculate the distances between the storm center and each grid point in the dataset. We then identified the grid point closest to the storm center.</p>
            <p>Next, we identified closed SLP loops by labeling contiguous areas of relatively low SLP values. Specifically, we considered regions where SLP values were below the median (50th percentile) of all SLP values in the dataset. This threshold allowed us to identify a manageable number of closed loops while ensuring that these loops represented significant low-pressure systems. We then calculated the centroid of each closed loop to determine their central coordinates. For each loop, we checked if the storm center was within the loop's boundaries.</p>
            <p>Among the loops containing the storm center, we selected the one with the centroid farthest from the storm center by calculating the distances from the storm center to the centroids of these loops. We then calculated the area of this selected loop and created a mask corresponding to this loop, which we used for subsequent precipitation analysis. This mask allowed us to isolate and study the precipitation associated with the identified closed SLP loop.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/slp precipitation segment.png" alt="the left side plot shows the closed SLP loop plotted on a map and the right side plot shows the loop surrounding a masked set of precipitation data.

Precipitation is masked to only include data within the chosen SLP closed loop.</p>
        </figure>
            <p>This method was not applied to the entire ETC database, but future work on the project should include this. The source code for this method is available on this project's Github repository in the <a href="https://github.com/lilykdonaldson/NASA-CCRI-Extreme-Precipitation/tree/main/ETC-search-and-identify/segmenting_storm_precipitation">"Segmenting Storm Precipitation" folder</a>. </p>

This animation shows the identified SLP loop mask (outlined in red) found for each timestep of a portion of the storm. For each timestep, the precipitation (from ERA-5 reanalysis) was masked with the timestep's SLP loop mask so that only precipitation data within the SLP loop was included. The animation shows this masked precipitation for five timesteps of the storm.</p>

            <h4>Output: a Database of ETCs</h4>
            <p>
                Extratropical Cyclones (ETCs) were identified using the above methods for the U.S. East Coast and West Coast in MERRA-2 and ERA5 reanalysis data and stored in databases used in the analysis described below. The database containing ETCs within MERRA-2 included bomb cyclone identification and atmospheric river concurrency identification based on atmospheric rivers identified in GISS ModelE2.1 nudged to MERRA-2 horizontal winds (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL105828">LeGrande et al. 2024</a>) due to availability at the time of creating the database. The MERRA-2 database included data from 2007-2021.</p>
            <p>
                The database containing ETCs within ERA5 included bomb cyclone identification but did not include atmospheric river concurrency metrics due to data availability and resolution processing issues. The MERRA-2 database included data from 1950-2023. In the future, the algorithms used to create the ETC databases should be rerun using atmospheric river data in MERRA-2 and ERA5 identified by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03258-4">Guan and Waliser 2024</a>, of which the global database of ARs in both MERRA-2 and ERA5 is available on <a href="https://dataverse.ucla.edu/dataverse/ar">UCLA Dataverse</a>).

            <h3>Storm Track Density Plots</h3>
            <p>Once the database of ETCs was completed, we began by plotting the ETC storm tracks. Because of the large number of ETCs in the dataset, these storm track plots were not very readable past the monthly time scale, so we developed storm track density plots to translate this information. Below is an example of a storm track plot of which the density plots are based on.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p>Based on ERA5 reanalysis 1950-2023, there were nearly 390% more extratropical cyclones on the U.S. East Coast than on the U.S. West Coast, and it was ~6 times more likely for an East Coast ETC to undergo bombogenesis than a West Coast ETC. Based on MERRA-2 reanalysis 2007-2021, there were nearly 200% more extratropical cyclones on the U.S. East Coast than on the U.S. West Coast. It was ~3.5 times more likely for an East Coast ETC to undergo bombogenesis than a West Coast ETC. Within MERRA-2 reanalysis, 84% of Bomb Cyclones on the East Coast were concurrent with an Atmospheric River. In both ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis, extratropical cyclones tend to occur in the Northern Hemisphere between 30N and 50N latitude. </p>

            The MERRA-2 output above depicts a drop in sea level pressure as two separate bomb cyclones impacted the Northeastern U.S. We can see the significant drop in sea level pressure, predominantly along and off the Northeast coast as the cyclones tracked through the region. Note that the MERRA-2 reanalysis depicts that the greatest drop in sea level pressure in both cyclones occurred near or around the 40N-70W latitude, longitude lines. This seems to be a consistently common location for developing cyclones to bomb out as they impact the Northeast.</p>

This ridge sends cold air southward from Canada/arctic regions, which then clashes with the warmer tropical air mass situated over the southern central U.S. This clashing then leads to the rapid development and intensification of a low pressure system as it tracks Northeast toward and up the east coast.

            <p>NAO was compared with extratropical and bomb cyclone formation rates by month, and up to 28 days before storm formation. NAO- within seven days of storm formation was found to be associated with more extratropical cyclones, and NAO- from three to fourteen days before storm formation was found to be associated with more bomb cyclones. Upon storm formation, NAO- is associated with more extratropical cyclones, but not with more bomb cyclones.</p>

            <p>Arctic Oscillation (AO) tracks the pressure difference between the Arctic and the Mid-latitudes, and the strength of the westerly winds surrounding the Arctic. An AO- indicates weak westerly winds, allowing Arctic air to escape equatorward, while an AO+ indicates strong westerly winds, leading to colder temperatures in the Arctic and milder temperatures in the mid-latitudes. (El Niño & Other Oscillations)</p>
            <p>AO was compared with extratropical and bomb cyclone formation rates by month, and up to 28 days before storm formation. Between October and March, An AO- is associated with higher extratropical cyclone formation rates from zero to 28 days before storm formation, and is associated with higher bomb cyclone formation rates from three to 28 days before storm formation. Upon storm formation, AO- is associated with more extratropical cyclones, but not with more bomb cyclones.</p>
            <p>Note the large degree of noise in the two middle columns. This is because AO has a relatively high standard deviation, close to 1.6. there are relatively few days with an AO amplitude of less than 0.5.</p>

            <p>Pacific-North American Oscillation (PNA) tracks atmospheric patterns in the North Pacific and over the North American continent. Throughout most of the winter, a PNA+ is associated with a cooler East Coast and a warmer West Coast; the reverse is associated with a -PNA. (El Niño & Other Oscillations)</p>
            <p>PNA was compared with extratropical and bomb cyclone formation rates by month, and up to 28 days before storm formation. Between October and March, a PNA+ is associated with higher extratropical and bomb cyclone formation rates from zero to 21 days before storm formation. Upon storm formation, PNA+ is associated with more extratropical and bomb cyclones.</p>

        </figure>
            <p>The La Niña ENSO state during the winter months is strongly associated with higher mean sea level pressures over the southeast U.S. This area of sinking air unsurprisingly cuts off the subtropical jet and weakens/prevents the development and cyclonic organization of many atmospheric impulses that may move through the region. We can see a lack of significant precipitation near and off of the southeast U.S. coast during the three La Niña winters, with the core of the highest precip amounts falling far to the Northeast out in the open atlantic. This implies that ETC development is delayed until the impulses move further out to sea (away from the influence of the dominant southeast ridge.) It is this delay in intensification that hampers the frequency of bomb cyclones along and off the east coast during La Niña winters.</p>

        </figure>
            <p>Here, a randomly selected Non-La Niña winter shows the characteristics of a far more active subtropical jet. We can see that the mean sea level pressures are significantly lower when compared to the other three La Niña winters. This implies a far less hostile environment for the rapid development of ETCs near and off the southeast coast. It is also evident that the highest precip amounts are located far Southwest relative to the other three La Niña winter case studies, which indicates that ETCs and bomb cyclones develop far quicker, and closer to the coast during non-La Niña winters when compared to La Niña winters.</p>

            <h2>Research Conclusions and Next Steps</h2>
            <p>Of the identified extratropical cyclones and the eastern and western coasts of the United States, there were markedly less extratropical cyclones and bomb cyclones on the west coast than the east coast. Extratropical Cyclones on the U.S. East Coast are more likely to occur and experience bombogenesis, and to be concurrent with an atmospheric river, than on the west coast.</p>
            <p>We found that within the reanalysis data, extratropical cyclone frequency is higher during PNA+ and NAO- events, and after AO- events, and bomb cyclone frequency is higher during PNA+ events, and after AO- events. We observed little measured influence on extratropical or bomb cyclone frequency from ENSO or AMO state.</p>
            <h4>Next Steps</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Apply the storm-specific precipitation segmentation algorithm to the ETC datasets.</li>
                <li>Switch the AR-concurrency algorithm to use reanalysis specific AR data rather than data from the GISS model.</li>
                <li>Determine how to apply the ETC identification algorithm used in the MERRA-2 and ERA-5 Fronts ETC data product to the GISS ModelE.</li>
                <li>Determine the GISS model’s accuracy at predicting the frequency and intensity of ETCs, by applying the methods to nudged model runs.</li>
                <li>Apply the methods to future runs of the GISS model under different relative concentration pathways (RCPs) to determine how future climate change scenarios may affect ETC representation and intensity.</li>
                <li>Analyze why observed (and inferred) ETC and bomb cyclone changes are occurring.</li>

            <h2>Education and Community Outreach</h2>
            <p>The education component of the CCRI experience centers on creating a unit plan designed to make complex scientific concepts about extreme precipitation accessible and engaging for high school students. The unit plan leverages ArcGIS StoryMaps, allowing students to explore and present data about extreme weather events in their own neighborhoods or hometowns. This approach ensures that learning is relevant and impactful by connecting it to students' personal experiences and communities. Additionally, active involvement in community STEM engagement events fosters a love for science and technology among diverse groups of people including students, teachers, school and district administrators, and broader audience who are interested in STEM education. These events range from workshops and presentations to interactive activities, all aimed at making STEM education accessible and exciting for everyone, regardless of their background. By involving the community in these educational experiences, the goal is to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers and to demonstrate the practical importance of scientific research in everyday life.</p>
