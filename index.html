        <h1>Deciphering Changing Probabilities of Extreme Climate Events in Climate Models and Measurements</h1>
        <p>This project was developed during the 2023-2024 session of <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/edu/ccri/">NASA GISS' Climate Change Research Initiative.</a></p>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Mean changes in temperature and precipitation under a changing climate are well-understood, but future changes to extreme weather, particularly precipitation, are less known. In this project, we explored the implications of warmer and wetter weather conditions induced by climate change on extratropical cyclones (ETCs) in the Northern Hemisphere. ETCs, including Bomb Cyclones (a particularly intense form of ETC), are responsible for 80% of winter precipitation in mid-latitudes (Naud et al. 2022). However, the future frequency and intensity of ETCs under a changing climate are unknown. Additionally, atmospheric rivers will become more frequent and intense under a warming climate (Zhang et al. 2024), and ETCs that are concurrent with these ARs tend to be more intense (Zhang et al. 2019). We aimed to investigate how the frequency and intensity of bombing extratropical cyclones, including those that are concurrent with an atmospheric river, are changing under a warming climate, and if these changes are accurately reflected in climate models. We developed a method for identifying extratropical cyclones in gridded datasets which we applied to MERRA-2 and ERA-5 reanalysis data. We found that within the reanalysis data, extratropical cyclone frequency is higher during PNA+ and NAO- events, and bomb cyclone frequency is higher during PNA+ events. In future research, trend analysis and application of the described method on CMIP6 simulations should be done to further understand how ETCs and Bomb Cyclones are changing. </p>
